"The Intersex Pride Flag was developed in 2013 by the co-chair of Intersex Human Rights Australia, Morgan Carpenter. Intersex people are those born with a variety of differences in their sex traits and reproductive anatomy. There is no one way to be intersex as everyoneâ€™s experience in unique. The creator chose yellow and purple as those are seen as gender neutral colors."
