"The Polyamory Pride Flag was created by Jim Evans in 1995 for all polyamorous people. Each color represents a different aspect of polyamory. Blue stands for openness and honesty of everyone involved, red represents love and passion, while black stands for solidarity with those who must hide their polyamorous relationships. The Pi sign in the middle signifies the infinite options of partners available to polyamorous people."
