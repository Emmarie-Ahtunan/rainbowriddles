# Rainbow Riddles
Rainbow Riddles is a game that challenges your knowledge of LGBTQIA+ Pride flags. Guess the flags, learn their meanings, and become an advocate for diversity and inclusion. 

Problem Statement: Limited knowledge and understanding of LGBTQIA+ Pride Flags hinder inclusivity and appreciation of diverse identities. Misidentification and confusion of pride flags perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings. Limited engagement in LGBTQIA+ educational initiatives restricts the dissemination of vital information. Creating unity within the LGBTQIA+ community can be challenging. Limited resources exist to educate children and young adults about LGBTQIA+ pride flags. 

Solution: Rainbow Riddles tackles these challenges by providing an interactive and educational platform that engages players in learning about various pride flags, their meanings, and historical significance. Through gameplay, players enhance their knowledge, reduce misconceptions, and promote accurate representation. The game fosters engagement, collaboration, and celebration of LGBTQIA+ pride flags, creating a sense of unity and stronger community bonds. Rainbow Riddles also offers an age-appropriate platform to introduce children and young adults to LGBTQIA+ pride flags, empowering the next generation with understanding, acceptance, and respect for diversity.
